### Project concept description:

I will be making a fully implemented version of my 
previous medical management system. To list off
where I am and where I am going, these are the
features I finished and will work on.

#### Features:
- I have questions that set up an appointment. The questions ask for: the time they want, are they a new patient, are they sick, what clinic they want, do they want a new PCP, the doctor they want, their full name, what reason they have for the appointment, if they have an insurance plan, if they have medical records we need to know about, and if they have any prior medication.
- There is minor logic that affects a patient's appointment time currently. There's an urgency and wait time feature that affect the appointment date.
- They are able to view, edit, and delete appointments as long as its theirs.

#### Future Features:
- I will be giving users different access depending on if they're a doctor or patient.
- I will implement the notes database I ran out of time for when initally working on this project.
- Doctors should be able to view all of their patient's appointments and their notes.
- Doctors will also be able to edit a limited amount of the patient's appointments and their notes.
- Doctors should also be able to replace a patient's appointments and their notes with an explanation for cancelations/edits.
- Patients should only be able to view/edit/cancel their own appointments and notes.
- There will be more automated logic based on the patients answers. e.g. The urgency feature prioritizes sick patients with quicker dates.

### High-level plan/description for each milestone:

#### milestone 0:
I should be done with this one when you read this.
I plan on having a proposal written for you by today.

#### milestone 1:
I plan on following the tutorial provided for
Spring boot to start on this. I should have a landing
page with a possible background and welcome text for the
user. This should require an index.html page and a home template.

#### milestone 2:
I want to have a page where the user can view appointments and
notes. It would be a page that redirects or tabs out the info
related to the section. This should require a user database,
appointments database, and a notes database.

#### milestone 3:
I want to have authentication for patients and doctors.
This will affect the scope what can be accessed by the
user. A patient will only have access to their information,
but a doctor will have access to all their patients information.
Otherwise it will be confidential. This should require user 
authentication, logic for recognizing patients and doctors, and
id and password data to work with.

### Expected timelines for each milestone:

#### milestone 0:
Morning block.

#### milestone 1:
- Done in week 1

#### milestone 2:
- Done between week 1-3

#### milestone 3:
- Done between week 3-5
