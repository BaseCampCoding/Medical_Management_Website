### Project concept description:

I want to take my medical management system,
and finish implementing the ideas I had for it
in this project. I'm hoping that I will be able
to add in the rest of the logic for the questions,
add different access levels for patients and doctors,
and possibly add more things to manage besides appointments.


### High-level plan/description for each milestone:

#### milestone 0:
I should be done with this one when you read this.
I plan on having a proposal written for you by today.

#### milestone 1:
I plan on following the tutorial you provided for
Spring boot to start on this. I want to follow it
through for most of these milestones before I start
my unit project version.

#### milestone 2:
As with milestone 1 I'll try to follow the YouTube
tutorial and learn anything that the tutorial misses
on my own.

#### milestone 3:
As with the other milestones, I'll see what I can get
done with the tutorial, and if it doesn't suffice,
I'll complete all three of these with the unit project
plans I have. The plan will require a database and user
authentication.

### Expected timelines for each milestone:

#### milestone 0:
Morning block.

#### milestone 1:
- Done in week 1: (1-2 days)

#### milestone 2:
- Done between week 1-2: (2-3 days)

#### milestone 3:
- Done between week 2-3: (2-3 days)
